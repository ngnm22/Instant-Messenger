# Instant-Messenger
This is a client-server system, which has an instant messenger using TCP allowing users to chat with each other. This instant messenger consists of a client and a server program. 
You can invoke server and client as follows: python server.py [port]python client.py [username] [hostname] [port]
For example, python client.py John 127.0.0.1 12000 would enable the client using the username “John” to connect to 127.0.0.1 (i.e., the local system) via port number 12000
